            <h2>About Puppy_Coded</h2>
            <p>
                Hey! I'm Puppy_Coded :3
                <br><br>
                I am currently studying a Bachelor of Digital Screen, majoring in Game Arts with a minor in Game Development.
                I'm still learning to make games, and still finding my flow and inspirations while I complete my study ^^;
                <br><br>
                One of my main drives is wanting to learn ways to bring my ideas and concepts to life, some of which have been sitting in my head for years.
                I love making games with cute and cosy styles, that are casual and fun to play.
                <br><br>
                Something of great importance to me is being able to one day make games with real and accurate LGBTQ+ representation, themes and characters;
                not only for the sake of awareness but also to help tell the stories and messages that feel important to me.
                <br>
                I also love games with animals or from an animal's perspective, and this is something I would love to integrate into my game designs in the future.

            <h2>Skill Areas</h2>
            <h4>Games</h4>
            <p>
                My main experience is making games in 3D and VR with Unity using C#, though I have some experience with 2D as well.
                My strongest area is in level design, I love making my environments look great and fun to play in.
                <br>
                I also have some experience with creating and rigging characters in Maya, as well as designing characters from the ground up.
            </p>
            <h4>Web</h4>
            <p>
                I also have worked as a front end Web Developer for a number of years, learning HTML and CSS, as well as occasional JS where needed.
                As well as this I learnt a lot about overall website design, and the creation of assets such as logos and animations.
